A Simple implementation of myself using agents to improve my own agentic coding workflow. I expect this repo to change ALOT especially as I look to intern and soon enter the workforce. Currently in its implementation I am following an approach where I start through an agent that will help me think through via opencode the problem, helping me understand think of a system and ensure that my ideas of delegation across subagents and orchestrating it is correct. From there it'll run these in parallel to ensure it runs smoothly.
